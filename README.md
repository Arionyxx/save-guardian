```

## Architecture

Save Guardian is built with a modular architecture:

- **`types.rs`** - Core data structures and error types
- **`steam.rs`** - Steam save detection and scanning
- **`non_steam.rs`** - Non-Steam save location scanning
- **`backup.rs`** - Backup creation, restoration, and management
- **`sync.rs`** - Save synchronization between Steam/non-Steam
- **`gui.rs`** - Modern UI implementation with egui
- **`config.rs`** - Configuration management

## Supported Games

Save Guardian works with thousands of games including:

- **Steam Games**: All games with Steam Cloud saves
- **Non-Steam Games**: Most PC games that store saves in standard locations
- **Cracked Games**: Games using common emulators like Goldberg
- **Unity Games**: Games storing data in LocalLow
- **Rockstar Games**: GTA series, Red Dead Redemption, etc.
- **EA Games**: Games storing saves in Documents
- **Ubisoft Games**: Games with standard save patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Game Name Display Issue

**Issue**: Some games may display incorrect names in the main game list (e.g., generic names like "Satisfactory" instead of the actual game name).

**Workaround**: 
1. **Use the search box** - Type the game name in the search box, then click backup. This ensures correct names are used.
2. **Use the Refresh button** - Click the "‚Üª Refresh" button to force update all game names.
3. **Automatic fix** - The app will automatically attempt to fix incorrect names on startup.

**Why this happens**: This occurs when cached game names haven't been updated from the Steam API yet. The search function triggers a refresh that fixes the names.

## Troubleshooting

### Steam Saves Not Detected
- Verify Steam is installed and has been run at least once
- Check Steam userdata path in Settings
- Ensure you have saves for the games (play them first)

### Non-Steam Saves Missing
- Check if games store saves in non-standard locations
- Add custom save locations in Settings
- Some games may use registry or other storage methods

### Backup/Restore Issues
- Ensure backup directory has sufficient space
- Check file permissions on save directories
- Some games may lock save files while running

### Sync Problems
- Ensure both save locations exist and are accessible
- Games must be closed during sync operations
- Check that save formats are compatible between versions
